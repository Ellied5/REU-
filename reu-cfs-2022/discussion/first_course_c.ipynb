The looping/iteration control structure in Python makes heavy use of *iterators*, that is, makes use of objects that are *iterable*. Such objects represent a sequence abstactly, with the ability to ask for the next item in the sequence, and a final mechanism for handling when there are no more items in the sequence.\n",

    "Illustrated is that these three data types are iterable: a list, a string and a tuple; and the range object as created by the range() function is also iterable. The above shows that they work uniformly. Each object responds to the *iter* function. This is the meaning of the pattern x.y(). That is: given object x, which supports the method y, invoke that method, most likely for use of the resulting value.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, a = range(3).iter( ) means, call range(3) to produce an object that represents sequence 0, 1, 2; then call on the object the iter function, to return an object capable of generating that sequence; and store that object in variable a.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now in possession of an iterator, we iterate for as long as we can. The call_next function has the line x.next(). This calls the next function on the object x. And having done that it calls it again. And again ... until True becomes False in the while condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next() function returns the next element, and that is printed, and also advances an internal cursor in the iterator so that subsequent next calls give subsequent elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "And how does the infinite loop end? Normal code flow would have it regress infinitely. But an exception is thrown that can break the loop, and break back upwards all contining loops, until a suitable try clause is found to catch the exception, handle it, and resume normal code progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of an iterable, a suitable try clause would be one expecting a StopException, or in the case of this code, any Exception, including the StopException.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Note:_ There are three ways to access the iteration machinery. \n",
    "\n",
    "* First, is to allow the language to do all the work. The \"for\" statement will take care of it all. \n",
    "* We showed above directly accessing the method attributes, whose names are surrounded in double underscores. \n",
    "* Similar names, without the underscores, are provided as language _built-ins_. I believe this discipline predates the more general machinery. I believe these now call the similarly named method, providing a more comprehensive and methodical language.\n",
    "\n",
    "As examples of the third method: next(a) gets rewritten to a.\\_\\_next\\_\\_() and a AttibuteError exception raised if no such method exists; iter(a) gets rewritten to a.\\_\\_iter\\_\\_(); and len(a) gets rewritten to a.\\_\\_len\\_\\_(). Some of this was discussed at <a href=\"https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-3000/2006-November/004643.html\">python.org</a> in 2006. Be happy you are witnessing the birth of a new language.

    "Python has as part of the language a wealth of complex datatypes. A large part of the strength of the language, are the native support of these datatypes. While each of the datatypes we shall mention now, have a personality of their own, and deserve individual study, as a collective, they are all iterables. There is a natural way that the datatype is a sequence of elements, and it is often natural to inspect and treat each element in the sequence, one by one.\n",
    "\n",
    "An arithmetic, integer sequence, is created by range(). While not exactly a data type, it is a class, and in Python, all things are objects. The simplest behavoir of range is to provide the traditional 0 through n-1 integer sequence. However it can be called for arbitrary start, stop and step values. What is created by the call isn't so much the sequence, but the possibility of the sequence. When an iterator is generated by the sequence object, it adds to the abstract definition of the sequence the possiblity of delivery of elements in the sequence. And finally those elements are delivered until an exception signals that it must stop.\n",
    "\n",
    "A *list* is the most versatile datatype in computer science. Python gives it an external representation, for the purposes of inputting and outputting lists, of a square brack enclosed, comma-seperated string. Elements can be accessed by index; lists can be appended to, inserting into, elements can be removed.\n"
